Crappy ripoff of FizzyText ([seen here](https://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage), [source here](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui/blob/gh-pages/docs/demo.js), [my attempted explanation here](http://bl.ocks.org/tophtucker/978513bc74d0b32d3795)) in which collision-detection (of particles with letterforms) is used to slow the particles down instead of engorge them. And then a third canvas is introduced which isn't cleared every frame, so the particles leave translucent streaks.

It looks like an inkjet printer!!

Refresh many times for streaky imperfect printing!
