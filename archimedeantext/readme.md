OK I know this doesn't quite make sense but it's a step. Visually looks better when mouse is moving vertically than horizontally. Spacing is a little off because it's just using the top-left corner of each letter. You can imagine a lot of variants. Like locking displacement to vertical moves, or somehow trying both, or having the letters displace immediately but seep back into position more gradually.... I want to have a block of text with 'raindrops' falling through it. Or something like [this](http://hakunamatata.house/contents/prologue), a flowing river of text scrolling around a fixed obstruction, rock in the stream. 

This would get slow with a lot more text. And this technique doesn't really generalize well to arbitrary shapes. If you're just looking to wrap around a shape, [CSS shapes](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/shapes/getting-started/) make a lot more sense, and I want to try, y'know, having javascript redrawing CSS shapes...

Man, Archimedes was so cool. I love [Alfred North Whiteheadâ€™s account](https://medium.com/@tophtucker/a-n-whitehead-1911-693a343371f#.q3lxubkcf).
