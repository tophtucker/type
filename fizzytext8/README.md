Curlz SD font by Steph Davidson.

Canvas code is crappy ripoff of FizzyText ([seen here](https://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage), [source here](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui/blob/gh-pages/docs/demo.js), [my attempted explanation here](http://bl.ocks.org/tophtucker/978513bc74d0b32d3795)).

This one ditches the noise flow field. Picks up color of underlying canvas and if it's on a non-white pixel, draws a random spiral.
