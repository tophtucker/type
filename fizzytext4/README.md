Crappy ripoff of FizzyText ([seen here](https://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage), [source here](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui/blob/gh-pages/docs/demo.js), [my attempted explanation here](http://bl.ocks.org/tophtucker/978513bc74d0b32d3795)).

In this one, there are actually three canvases:

- One to get collision-detection info from  
- One that doesn't get cleared every frame, to show streaks  
- One that gets cleared every frame, to show the moving endpoints  

I set everything to the same color; the particles aren't picking up the color of what's underneath.
